Since you may not find anything interesting here, I provide you with a list of interesting websites.

Don't thank me just yet.

## Sites I read

- [XKCD](https://www.xkcd.com) 
- [Hacker News - Best](https://news.ycombinator.com/best)
- [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com)
- [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com)
- [DHH](https://medium.com/@dhh)

## Sites I read as well

- [Ricardo Peres](https://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes) I work with this fellow. He knows a thing or two... but probably not much because he talked me into creating my personal website. Go figure!
- [Nuno Gon√ßalves](https://medium.com/@nunogonalves) Another friend. He turned to the dark side (ios developer), but we still talk.
