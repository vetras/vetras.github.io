Some say the best way to learn something is to try to explain it.
If you can't articulate your speech then you don't really understand the subject.
Well, here I put that theory to the test.

I'm a Portuguese software developer based in [Aveiro](https://goo.gl/maps/KFDvvPNoEeR2).
I've mainly worked with server-side technologies but I do adventure into web development.

Whatever I do, I aim to do it better tomorrow.
The software development ecosystem changes too rapidly and is constantly evolving.
I try to keep on learning every day and I do enjoy it!
In my opinion, any developer who stays in his comfort zone too long, will eventually be outdated and the things he knows today will be worthless (or invaluable).

Learning is the only way forward, and I wouldn't have it any other way!
