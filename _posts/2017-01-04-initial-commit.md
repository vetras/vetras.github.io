Hello Internet! There is a new blog in town.

I build sites for a living, but oddly enough I do not have a website of my own.
Had, ... humm I mean, did not had...

I will share my ideas and opinions publicly and for free, as in "free beer". Be advised.
Therefor, I took the time to add disqus to all posts so that you can tell me just how wrong I am on the internet!

If you have loads of free time and are bored to death multiple times a day, I also have a:
<div markdown="0">
    <a href="/feed.xml" class="btn">RSS FEED</a>
</div>

(Do RSS feeds still exist in 2017? humm... Must investigate this later...)

And don't forget to check "The Cool Internet" where I keep a list of (only) better sites than this one:
<div markdown="0">
    <a href="/the-cool-internet/" class="btn">The Cool Internet</a>
</div>
